– List the files included in the archive and their purpose

userclient.py: communication with user only. 
server.py: handle communication, store game history, determine winner, move validation etc
ai.py: generate a random move and send it to the server 

– Explain how to compile and run your project

Unfortunately does not compile. I will appreciate any feedback to actually get it running though. This was my second time working 
with python so I apologize if my code is rough around the edges. 

– Include any other notes that the TA may need

If you need pictures of any brainstoriming please go ahead and contact me. I documented my process to help me 
implement this but of course I had trouble working with python. I didn't try this in java because I spent way to much time 
getting the sample python to work on my computer and eventually felt more comfortable with that since when I tired running the sample
java code it didn't work and didn't have time to understand why it wasn't working and trying to fix it.
